## Project Still A Work In Progress

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) calculator app partly meant to mirror an Apple calculator bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 

Codebase leverages:
```bash
UseReducer Hook
Context API
CSS theming and styling
Container and Presentational Components Pattern
Typescript
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
